# Assignment-1-mySQL
# DDL Commands
In this assignment, we have demonstrated various Data Definition Language (DDL) operations on a database table.
We started by creating a database named `School` and a table `STUDENT` with fields such as `Roll_No`,
`Name`, `Marks`, and `Grade`. We then performed several key DDL operations, including:

- **Creating** the table and inserting sample data.
- **Altering** the table by adding and removing columns.
- **Renaming** the table from `STUDENT` to `CLASSTEN`.
- **Truncating** the table to remove all rows.
- **Dropping** the table to permanently delete it from the database.
